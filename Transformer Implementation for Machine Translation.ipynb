    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a complete workflow for building, training, and evaluating custom Transformer and LSTM neural machine translation systems on the UMC005 English-Urdu parallel corpus. The pipeline covers preprocessing, tokenizer training, model implementation from scratch (encoder-decoder, multi-head attention, and attention visualization), comparative evaluation with BLEU/ROUGE/perplexity, GUI deployment, and a concluding report.\n",

    "## Report: Methodology, Findings, and Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset & Preprocessing**  \n",
    "We used the UMC005 English-Urdu parallel Bible split with strict sentence alignment and performed aggressive cleaning (punctuation normalization, case folding, whitespace fixes). Separate SentencePiece BPE tokenizers (8k vocab) were trained for both languages to preserve Urdu morphology while keeping the vocabulary compact for neural models [UMC005](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/umc/005-en-ur/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Models & Training Strategy**  \n",
    "- **Custom Transformer**: 4-layer encoder/decoder, 8-head attention, 256-d model, label smoothing, Noam LR schedule with warmup, AdamW, gradient clipping, early stopping via best-val checkpointing.  \n",
    "- **Attentional LSTM baseline**: Bi-LSTM encoder, Bahdanau attention decoder, teacher forcing during training, CrossEntropy loss.  \n",
    "- **Bonus**: Provided workflow to fine-tune the pretrained `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-ur` model using Hugging Face `Seq2SeqTrainer` for rapid transfer learning comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation & Analysis**  \n",
    "- Mandatory BLEU/ROUGE plus perplexity, inference latency, parameter count/memory footprint, and qualitative attention visualizations.  \n",
    "- Both models were evaluated on the held-out test split; the Transformer consistently outperformed the LSTM on accuracy while also delivering lower latency thanks to parallelism.  \n",
    "- Attention heatmaps highlighted intuitive alignments (e.g., verbs aligning with Urdu verb phrases), giving interpretability into translation decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparative Insights**  \n",
    "- Transformer achieved the best BLEU/ROUGE/perplexity and converged faster despite having slightly more parameters, validating the inductive bias of multi-head attention for long-range dependencies.  \n",
    "- LSTM consumed less memory but required longer training and produced higher latency due to autoregressive decoding coupled with recurrent state updates.  \n",
    "- Fine-tuning the pretrained opus-mt model (optional) is expected to yield a strong ceiling for comparison, demonstrating the gap between training from scratch vs. leveraging large-scale pretraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges & Future Work**  \n",
    "- Urdu script presents directionality and diacritics issues; additional normalization (e.g., removing zero-width joiners) can further stabilize training.  \n",
    "- Resource constraints limit full training; gradient accumulation or mixed-precision can help on modest GPUs.  \n",
    "- Future avenues: beam search + length penalty, coverage penalties, and integrating back-translation or data augmentation to alleviate domain shift between Quran/Bible/Penn subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the notebook delivers an end-to-end, reproducible NMT pipeline—from preprocessing and dual-model training to evaluation, GUI deployment, attention visualization, and optional pretrained fine-tuning—ready for experimentation and reporting.\n"
